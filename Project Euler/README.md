# Project Euler

The [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) website describes itself as follows:

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

It is a good source of fun problems when you are trying to learn a new language. We use it here to illustrate basic Java syntax, and how to make code more generalized and reusable.

## Problem 1

We are using [problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) to refresh Java syntax and motivate software design. The problem is stated as follows:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> 
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

When the max is 10, the solution is 23. When the max is 100, the solution is 2318.
